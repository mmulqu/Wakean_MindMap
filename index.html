              Sir Tristram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea, had passen-
          core rearrived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy
          isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war: nor
          had topsawyer's rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse
          to Laurens County's gorgios while they went doublin their mumper
          all the time: nor avoice from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to

          on life down through all christian minstrelsy. The great fall of the
          offwall entailed at such short notice the pftjschute of Finnegan,
